        <h3>About Me </h3>

        <p>
            I grew up in a small town about an hour NE from Iowa City with a population of just under 4,000 people. It 
            was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other and we all looked out for each other. Life was 
            slow-paced and I enjoyed the quietness of the town. I had my group of friends, my favorite local spots, 
            and my own routines. However, after living in a small town for most of my life, I decided I wanted to go to
            college in Iowa City with almost 75,000 people. This was a big change for me, and it took some getting used
            to. Suddenly, there were so many people and so many different things to do. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The first thing I noticed was the pace of life. It was fast and busy. People are always on the move and there
            is always something happening. Adjusting to the traffic and the pedestrians was definitely overwhelming at first,
            but I slowly began to adapt. Living in Iowa City has definitely opened up many opportunities for me. There is always 
            something to do or see, whether it's attending a concert, going to a football game, shopping, or seeing new friends. 
            Despite the initial challenges, living in Iowa City has been an exciting adventure, and I have learned so much about 
            myself and the world around me. I have been exposed to new cultures, ideas, and experiences that I would never have 
            had the opportunity to encounter in a small town.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before attending the University of Iowa, I received my associates degree in Business Administration at Kirkwood
            Community College. This took about a year, but due to COVID-19 I was able to live at home and take online classes. 
            I graduated Kirkwood with just under 90 credits, since I was able to receive free college credit throughout my junior
            and senior year of high school. Since moving to Iowa City, I have changed my major a couple of times. I knew I wanted
            to study business but didn't know which path I wanted to take. I ended up double majoring in Finance & Business Analytics,
            and I would like to think that I am in the right place now. I will graduate in May of this year and I am looking forward to
            spending a year traveling since I am fortunate enough to graduate a year early.
