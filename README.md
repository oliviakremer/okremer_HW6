Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository! This is my homework assignment for digital product management, where I was tasked with creating an index.html and index2.html page using HTML and CSS formatting.

In this assignment, I applied my knowledge of HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and informative portfolio page. The index.html page serves as the homepage, providing a brief introduction to the website and linking to the index2.html page. The index2.html page provides more in-depth information about.

Throughout the project, I focused on creating a user-friendly design and ensuring that the website is accessible to all users. I also paid attention to details such as responsive design to ensure that the website displays properly on all devices.

I hope that you find this project informative and enjoyable to view. Thank you for taking the time to check it out!
